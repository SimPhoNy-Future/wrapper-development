# Wrapper Development
*Version*: 2.4.0

The aim of this project is simplify as much as possible the development of a new Wrapper for __SimPhoNy v3__.
For this, the general folder and file structure of a wrapper is simulated here, and notes on what to do are provided.

We **strongly** recommend going through the [documentation](https://simphony.readthedocs.io/)
(in particular the wrapper development section) first.
